## Next Steps for Post-Processing Features

### Phase 1: Python Feature Engineering Script
Create `ai/scripts/feature_engineering.py` to:
1. Read `dataset.csv`
2. Group by `player_address` for historical features
3. Extract device info fields from JSON
4. Calculate cross-round statistics
5. Compute temporal features
6. Fill 'NA' values with calculated results
7. Output enriched dataset

### Phase 2: Blockchain Integration
Add to `server.js` or separate blockchain service:
1. Track transaction receipts (block number, timestamp, gas price, position)
2. Monitor mempool for front-running detection
3. Query blockchain for on-chain features (balance, tx history)
4. Analyze contract events for daily challenge/leaderboard timing

### Phase 3: Multi-Account Detection
Create graph analysis scripts:
1. Cluster accounts by device_info_hash
2. Build transfer graph from blockchain
3. Calculate behavioral similarity scores
4. Detect coordinated activity patterns

### Phase 4: Advanced Analytics
Implement specialized detectors:
1. Mouse trajectory analysis (straightness, curvature, ballistic model)
2. Click pattern recognition (rhythm, hesitation, anticipation)
3. Strategic behavior classification (optimal path, exploration)
4. Anomaly detection (z-scores, outliers, volatility)

## Data Quality Assurance

### Real-time Feature Validation
- âœ… All 42 real-time features have data sources
- âœ… Click features validated against telemetry.clicks[]
- âœ… Mouse features validated against telemetry.mouseMoves[]
- âœ… Device features validated against telemetry.deviceInfo{}
- âœ… Verification features from server-side checks

### Post-processing Feature Requirements
- ðŸŸ¡ Cross-round features need multiple rounds per player
- ðŸŸ¡ Historical features need time-series data (24h, 7d windows)
- ðŸŸ¡ On-chain features need blockchain RPC access
- ðŸŸ¡ Timing features need transaction receipt tracking
- ðŸŸ¡ Multi-account features need cross-player analysis

### Missing Data Handling
- Default: 'NA' for all post-processing features
- Python scripts replace 'NA' with computed values
- Missing values remain 'NA' if insufficient data (e.g., new player with 1 round)
- XGBoost handles missing values natively (treats 'NA' as special branch)
